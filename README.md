# ModularPowershellProject

This project is a long-term effort to build a modular, scalable PowerShell tool that automates small, repetitive tasks to make daily work easier and more efficient. Over time, new features will be added to handle various automation needs, such as file management, system checks, or other helpful utilities.

The project is designed to be modular, meaning each feature will be built as an independent component. This ensures the tool remains organized, easy to update, and adaptable to future needs. By focusing on simplicity and reusability, the goal is to create a tool that grows with time while remaining easy to maintain.

This is a hands-on, evolving project, and the emphasis will be on clean, efficient code and thoughtful design to support long-term use. Let’s get started!

Also mention that this is the second time that I use PowerShell

It’s worth noting that this is only the second time I’m working with PowerShell, so this project will also serve as a learning experience. The focus will be on writing clean, efficient code and improving my understanding of PowerShell’s capabilities as the project evolves.

This is a hands-on, evolving project, and the emphasis will be on thoughtful design and continuous improvement.
